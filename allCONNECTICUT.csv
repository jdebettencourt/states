After drifting slowly southwest on October 23, Sandy turned to the north and intensified to a hurricane on October 24, just before making landfall in Jamaica.  Hurricane Sandy continued to the north and intensified to a strong category two hurricane before making landfall again in Cuba shortly after Midnight EDT on the 25th.  Hurricane Sandy emerged on the other side of Cuba during the morning of the 25th and proceeded to drift northwest as a category one or two hurricane as it moved through the Bahamas on the 25th and 26th.  Overnight on the 26th, Hurricane Sandy (Category 1) started to move toward the north northeast, a motion that continued into the evening of the 28th.  From there, Sandy���s motion became driven by two factors.  An anomalously strong blocking ridge over the Canadian Maritimes prevented Sandy from escaping to the east.  Simultaneously, an approaching and deepening extratropical trough was about to capture Sandy.  The combination of the two, turned Sandy to the north overnight on the 28th and then to the northwest on the 29th.  ||As Sandy continued to move northwest and interact with the mid latitude trough,  its interaction continued to make it less tropical, but did not weaken it much. Sandy continued to make a harder turn to the left (west) and made landfall in Atlantic County as a post tropical storm in Brigantine City just north of  Atlantic City at 730  p.m. EDT on the 29th.   The estimated minimum central pressure was  945 millibars. The lowest recorded central pressure was 945.6 millibars at the Atlantic City Marina at 734 p.m. EDT.||Record breaking high tides and wave action was combined with sustained winds of 40 to 60 mph and wind gusts of 80 to 90 mph.||These extreme conditions resulted in at least 5 deaths and widespread property damage of at least 360 million dollars.||Emergency managers recommended mandatory evacuations of 362,000 people that lived in low lying areas.

Although the storm began transitioning into a non-tropical nor'easter storm, it remained an extremely powerful cyclone. As the storm made landfall in southern New Jersey during the evening of October 29th, bands of rain moved across western New England.

Rainfall amounts were generally around an inch with the highest amount being reported 1.63 inches in New Milford.||However, strong and gusty winds in association with the storm caused damage to trees and power lines across the region.
